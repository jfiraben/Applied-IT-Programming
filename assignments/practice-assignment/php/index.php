				<h2><em>Professional & Personal Details</em></h2>
				<p>I was born and raised in Florida. My family moved to Virginia sometime in the summer of 2002. I attended high school in Springfield, Virginia and graduated in 2008. I've attended
				James Madison University, Northern Virginia Community College, and now George Mason University. Over the years I've had a few jobs. I was a substitute teacher and extended care worker
				at a local middle school until summer 2016. Since summer 2016, I've worked at the George Mason ITS Support Center as a student analyst. After graduating, I plan on pursuing a career
				in IT-- HelpDesk, Network Administrator, Network Engineer. </p>
				<p>I enjoy hanging out with friends and my girlfriend on the weekends. The DC area has plenty of activities, although it is fast-paced and compact. After graduating, I'm strongly
				considering moving out of the area to another location.</p>
